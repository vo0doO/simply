# Members

Enable Subscribers by checking the Enable Members checkbox on the Labs page in your Ghost admin panel.

## Portal

Go in your Ghost's `dashboard -> Settings -> Members -> Portal`

By default, Simply uses Portal for member management. If you prefer, Simply also comes with individual pages to support the membership function.

> If you want to use with individual pages let me know. I will create a more functional version.
